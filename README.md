## Dogs vs. Cats (Asirra dataset)
I'm starting by completing a submission to the Dogs vs. Cats Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
I'll uses the results and images later to contribute to the training of the binary cat identifier.
The code expects the data to be organized as show in the tree above. You'll need to download the data, unzip everything and rename the folder from `all` to `data`.
